Matcha Characteristics 

Drink matcha to refresh but not as strong as coffee 
It isn’t bitter. 

It doesn’t make your heart race. 

It clears your mind just a little. 

It tastes clean and smooth. 

Its color is calming. 

And it wakes you up without that electric jolt. 

 

Matcha background 
Matcha was first created by monks who needed to stay awake. 
During the Song dynasty, Zen monks ground tea leaves into a fine powder and brought this practice to Japan, using it to remain clear-minded during long hours of meditation. 
They called it the “Tea of Awakening.”

Emerging brand (founded ~2022) emphasising aesthetic packaging and lifestyle marketing.  
Packaging uses bold color (bright blue tin, neon green label) and branding aesthetics that appeal to younger, trend-driven consumers. 
Implication: If your target is younger/lifestyle oriented (TikTok/Instagram), visual boldness helps. But premium vs mass positioning will shift how bold vs understated the logo should be. 

 

Brief: Most Viral Matcha brand will be TikTok, Face to Gen Z , Take over the market of Redbull and Monster like Energy Drink
