Store Vibe 

 

Drink matcha to refresh but not as strong as coffee 
It isn’t bitter. 

It doesn’t make your heart race. 

It clears your mind just a little. 

It tastes clean and smooth. 

Its color is calming. 

And it wakes you up without that electric jolt. 

 

Matcha background 
Matcha was first created by monks who needed to stay awake. 
During the Song dynasty, Zen monks ground tea leaves into a fine powder and brought this practice to Japan, using it to remain clear-minded during long hours of meditation. 
They called it the “Tea of Awakening.”
